Big Data Storage Project
Task: 
- Think about any commercial business process of a product or service that needs a MongoDB database.
Describe it in 1 page. 
- Explain why you chose the specific company and why this dataset fits in the
MongoDB structure.
- Select a dataset to be modelled in MongoDB. If your dataset is not in a JSON or CSV file format, it must
be converted before being imported into MongoDB. Your database should have at most 10 different
collections. 
- Validate that imported data is assigned the correct data type and identify any needed operations to
improve the data quality. Add at least 5 validation rules to ensure imported data is valid. 
Define at least 10 different queries that output interesting business insights from the imported dataset.
- Optimize your queries using indexes. Include in the report how the usage of indexes impacted query
performance.
- Use at least 5 different aggregations with one or more stages that improve the information of the
dataset.
